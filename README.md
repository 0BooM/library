# library

After completing this project I feel more comfortable when it comes to managing the DOM and making site more functional than before.

Of course I must have googled some of the stuff to know what it does, how it works etc, but even I googled it I think that it is good for me, because after finding out how to properly google some stuff my work will be easier and I will find the answers faster.

The hardest thing in this project that I need someone to help me with (in this case it was ChatGPT) was the removing button, but after reading the explanations and reading the code I know how it works and why it is better and faster solution. I also refreshed my memory about forEach and that it also returns some things like index of an item in an array.
This was the hardest thing and I used ChatGPT for it, but the rest was pretty clear and straightforward and I didn't use ChatGPT, I was only searching google for docs or some StackOverflow questions.

I'm ready for the next lessons and next projects. But I'm becoming to be a little worried about the next ones, like Tick Tack Toe. Maybe after next lesson it will be easy for me. Hopefully :D!
